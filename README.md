# 🏡 Bayesian Housing Price Prediction

This project applies **Bayesian Linear Regression** to predict housing unit prices in Taipei, Taiwan, using real-world data. Beyond point predictions, it captures **uncertainty** through credible intervals and posterior predictive checks — providing a complete probabilistic view.

Built with Python, visualized with love.
